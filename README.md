# React-athon

For today's hackathon, we will be creating a web experience using data from an api.

## Task 1 - API Research (20 - 30 mins)

Choose an API(s) for a full stack React app, this [list](https://apilist.fun) may help however feel free to pick any API you like. You can always fall back on pokemon/Star Wars if needs be.

## Task 2 - Ideate and Plan (30 - 60 mins)

Use Disney ideation to come up with an idea of what you want to build. Then decide what your MVP is, and make it so that you can achieve your MVP before lunch. Break down your idea into its component parts, and prioritise your tasks.

## Task 3 - Build your MVP (60 - 180 mins)

Have the most simple version of your app (just enough features to be useable) working before lunch. Make regular commits as you build each component. Consider using React Router, useReducer, useEffect, etc.. if appropriate.

## Task 4 - Deployment
Deploy your MVP on Netlify as soon as possible. Each time you push a new version of your app to Github, Netlify should automatically rebuild and deploy it. If your app uses environment variables, be sure to configure these on Netlify.

## Task 5 - Stretch Goals

Focus on what features you are going to build next. Break it down into tasks/tickets that you can work on. Make use of feature branching and atomic commits.

## Show & Tell @ 16:00

You'll be presenting your apps to each other, and each team member should be prepared to present about their app so an end of day wrap-up is a good idea.
